All math documentation is in this file

Basic Math Functions:
    Basic math is extremely simple in BrittainScript:
        Addition: +
        Subtraction: -
        Division: /
        Multiplication: *

            
            From now on documentation will have examples as well

Algebra:
    There is a number of algebraic expressions available in
    BrittainScript:
        Squareroot:
            To squareroot a number
            Example:
                sqrroot(16)
                That will produce 4
        Power:
            To put something to the power of
            Example:
                4^2
                Which will produce 16
        Pi:
            Add pi into your code
            Example:
                5 * pi
                Which would result in 15.7

Trignometry:
    Although there is no graphs available, you can still use sine,
    cosine, and tangent:
        Sine:
            Get the value of a sine wave in degrees
            Example:
                sin(14)
                sin(14) = 56.8
        Cosine:
            Get the value of a cosine wave in degrees
            Example:
                cos(14)
                cos(14) = 7.8
        Tangent:
            Get the value of a tangent wave in degrees
            Example:
                tan(14)
                tan(14) = 415.1
